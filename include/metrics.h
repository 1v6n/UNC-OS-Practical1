 * @brief Header file for retrieving system metrics from the /proc filesystem.
 *
 * This header file declares functions used to retrieve various system metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk
 * stats, CPU temperature, and more from the /proc filesystem. These metrics are essential for monitoring system
 * performance and health.
 *
 * The functions include methods to read and parse data from the /proc filesystem, providing detailed statistics on
 * system resources. The metrics are used to track the performance and status of the system in real-time.
